I am a PhD Candidate at The University of Kansas, studying Geology, where I focus on Glaciology. My passion is in combining geospatial data with machine learning and deep learning towards climate change studies, environmental conservation, and sustainability. 

My research dives into climate change by studying calving processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet using satellite imagery, machine learning, and image processing. I work on large scale geospatial datasets, with a focus on using open-source technologies and automation.

Along with my work, I also enjoy painting (mainly abstract expressionism, analytical cubism, and impressionism), and photography.
