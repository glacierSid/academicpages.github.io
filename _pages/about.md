I am a PhD Candidate at The University of Kansas, studying Geology, where I focus on Glaciology. 
My passion is in combining remote sensing data with machine learning and deep learning towards climate change studies, environmental conservation, and sustainability.

My research dives into climate change by studying calving processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet using remote sensing imagery (optical & synthetic aperture radar), computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I work on creating and managing large scale remote sensing datasets, with a focus on using open-source technologies and automation.

Along with my work, I also enjoy painting (mainly abstract expressionism, analytical cubism, and impressionism), and photography.
