I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Center for Remote Sensing and Integrated Systems (CReSIS) at The University of Kansas. I focus on glaciology where I 
combine remote sensing with artificial intelligence towards climate change studies.

My research dives into climate change by studying calving processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet using remote sensing imagery (optical & synthetic aperture radar), computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I work on creating and managing large scale remote sensing datasets, with a focus on using open-source technologies and automation.

Along with my work, I also enjoy painting (mainly abstract expressionism, analytical cubism, and impressionism), and photography.
