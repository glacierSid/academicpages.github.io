I am a PhD student at The University of Kansas, studying Geology, where I focus on Glaciology. My passion is in combining geospatial solutions with machine learning towards environmental conservation and sustainability. My research dives into climate change by studying calving processes on the Greenland Ice Sheet using satellite imagery, machine learning, and image processing. I work on large scale datasets, with a focus on using open-source technologies and automation.

Along with my work, I also enjoy painting, mainly abstract expressionism, photography, and music production.
