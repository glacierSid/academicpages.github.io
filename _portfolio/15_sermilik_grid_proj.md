title: "Analysis of iceberg distribution in a Greenland fjord"
excerpt: "

The goal of this project is to analyze iceberg distribution in Sermilik Fjord, South East Greenland. Through this project I want to understand, how the calving processes are impacting Sermilik Fjord (one of the fastest moving glaciers in Greenland) using iceberg distribution.

In order to improve the understanding, I will need to perform the following tasks:

    Visualize iceberg distribution.
    Determine the frequency size distribution of icebergs in Sermilik Fjord.
    Calculate percentage ice-cover within 2km x 2km grid cells in Sermilik Fjord.

Icebergs represent nearly half of the mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet and provide a distributed source of freshwater along fjords which can alter fjord circulation, nutrient levels, and ultimately the Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we present analyses of high resolution optical satellite imagery using convolutional neural networks to accurately delineate iceberg edges in two East Greenland fjords. We find that a significant portion of icebergs in fjords are comprised of small icebergs that were not detected in previously-available coarser resolution satellite images. We show that the preponderance of small icebergs results in high freshwater delivery, as well as a short life span of icebergs in fjords. <br/>
