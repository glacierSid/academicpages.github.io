excerpt: 'Our automatic iceberg distribution algorithm and sea-ice classification algorithm relies on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with IW and EW swaths, at 10 m and 40 m pixel spacing. The freshwater estimates include iceberg melt arising from wave erosion, turbulent water motion, convection, wind driven melt, and solar radiation.'
