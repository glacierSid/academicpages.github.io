excerpt: 'Icebergs are an integral part of the climate system as they interact with the ocean, atmosphere and cryosphere. Most importantly, icebergs transport a substantial amount of fresh water away from the margins of the ice sheets and into the ocean, impacting sea ice formation, fjord circulation, and nutrient fluxes. To date, only a handful of studies quantify iceberg size distribution in the Arctic, and none do so on temporal scales that capture the physical processes of calving dynamics and fjord circulation. We use a combination of radar and optical imagery to quantify iceberg distribution in Uummannaq Bay, West Greenland. We also estimate the calving rate of glaciers in the region, to better understand calving style on a seasonal basis. The results are used to estimate the contribution of solid ice to the oceans from each glacier in the region, understand the calving style of glaciers in our region, and quantify temporal patterns in iceberg distribution.'
