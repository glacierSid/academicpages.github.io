excerpt: 'The outlet glaciers due to their interaction with ocean water experience sporadic changes at the terminus, which is an important predictive measure for understanding the longevity of their retreat. In this study, we present a tool that automatically identifies the changes in the terminus positions of 239 Greenland glaciers bi-weekly from 2017 to 2019.'
