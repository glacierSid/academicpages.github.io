excerpt: 'Time-series of iceberg distribution around Greenland are important for parameterizing calving processes, quantifying freshwater flux, and incorporating into coupled ice-ocean models. However, the size and frequency of icebergs around Greenland are largely unknown. Here we present results from our automated iceberg tracking algorithm, which classifies icebergs around Greenland every 2 weeks from 2016 to 2018. We use predominantly high-resolution IW Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and a combination of detection algorithms to characterize icebergs in open water, sea-ice and pro glacial mélange. Our algorithm first uses Random Forest (RF) supervised classification to mask out the various types of background (open water, sea ice, or proglacial mélange), isolating potential iceberg pixels. A modified Constant False Alarm algorithm further identifies iceberg boundaries.'
