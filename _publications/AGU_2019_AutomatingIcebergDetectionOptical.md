title: "Automating iceberg detection in Greenland using deep learning on high to moderate-resolution optical imagery"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'Iceberg calving constitutes nearly half of the mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, yet iceberg distribution around Greenland is poorly known. Icebergs act as a distributed source of fresh water to the ocean, reduce salinity, and affect fjord circulation. Therefore, quantifying the distribution of icebergs near the termini of outlet glaciers is important for understanding the solid flux of mass loss from ice sheets, as well as serving as a crucial input to global ocean models. The advent of remote sensing has greatly facilitated studying the distribution of icebergs. Since icebergs appear in a variety of shapes and sizes in polar regions, investigating their distribution requires robust automated tools. '
