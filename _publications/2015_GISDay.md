title: "Quantifying Iceberg Distribution in Rink Fjord using Satellite Remote Sensing"
collection: publications
# permalink: /publication/2015_GISDay
excerpt: 'Icebergs are an important part of Earthâ€™s freshwater cycle, affecting fjord circulation, marine biology, and nutrient flux. However, very little is known about iceberg distribution patterns, especially how iceberg sizes vary from glacier termini to the open ocean. Such information is critical for freshwater budgets and ocean circulation models. In this study, we quantify iceberg size and distribution in Rink Fjord, West Greenland during the summer of 2015. We show how the iceberg distribution changes throughout the summer season using Landsat 8, panchromatic images at 15 m resolution. The project algorithm runs on QGIS, ArcGIS, Python 2.7, and GDAL. We are working to automate the process so we can expand the study both spatially and temporally. The resulting dataset will help in understanding calving dynamics of different marine terminating glaciers and provide critical information for ocean and fjord models.'
